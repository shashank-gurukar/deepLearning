- **Epoch 4/10:** Loss: 0.9071, Accuracy: 68.70%
- **Epoch 5/10:** Loss: 0.8416, Accuracy: 70.97%
- **Epoch 6/10:** Loss: 0.7847, Accuracy: 72.62%
- **Epoch 7/10:** Loss: 0.7350, Accuracy: 74.48%
- **Epoch 8/10:** Loss: 0.6941, Accuracy: 75.74%
- **Epoch 9/10:** Loss: 0.6516, Accuracy: 77.31%
- **Epoch 10/10:** Loss: 0.6187, Accuracy: 78.36%

Observations

After 5 epochs, the CNN achieved a notable accuracy improvement, reaching around 70%. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks, particularly for handwritten digit recognition. Additionally, the CNN's computational efficiency is enhanced by max-pooling, which reduces image dimensions while preserving essential features.
